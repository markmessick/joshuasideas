              <h3>How Long Would it Take You to Complete Each of These Projects?</h3>
              <p>Some of them are definitely more ambitious than others, but I'll bet on average I could finish a single project in about 20-30 working hours. I would want to do it in my spare time though, just to see if I can actually complete them. I wouldn't want to work on these on the clock and then find out that they're not actually possible.</p>
              <h3>How Would You Complete These Projects?</h3>
              <p>I'm not entirely sure what kind of reports Pestroutes automatically generates. I could probably use a couple of those for some of the data I need, but I would primarily be using the Pestroutes API to retrieve data. I could also use a web scraping module such as BeautifulSoup to dig into the code of Pestroutes itself to pull out a few of the more complex pieces of data. And that's the hard part. As soon as I have the data in hand, all of these projects should be fairly straightforward to complete.</p>
              <h3>Why Do You Want to Do This?</h3>
              <p>I've put a lot of time and effort into learning all of these skills, and so far they haven't been used for anything in the real world. I would love to put them to the test and see what's possible. It would also look really good on my resume in the future and do a lot to build my portfolio.</p>
              <h3>What Other Kinds of Projects Can You Do?</h3>
              <p>I'm still only halfway done with my data analysis bootcamp, but here are the skills I feel fairly confident in as of right now:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Excel</li>
                  <li>VBA Scripting</li>
                  <li>Python Programming</li>
                  <li>Pandas Dataframes & Data Manipulation</li>
                  <li>MatPlotLib Chart Generation & Styling</li>
                  <li>API Interaction & Web Scraping</li>
                  <li>HTML/CSS Programming</li>
                  <li>SQL Database Management & Manipulation</li>
              </ul>
              <p>All of the project ideas that I've listed here on this site are pretty ambitious and would definitely stretch me. I'm sure there a lot of more lowkey projects I could do for you guys as well, using any of the skills listed above.</p>
